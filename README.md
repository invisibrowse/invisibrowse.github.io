Invisibrowse is a website (currently just a technical demo) that cannot be screenshotted or screenrecorded by the user or by spyware. For more information: read the code, visit the website at https://invisibrowse.github.io, or see the welcome message below.



Welcome to the Invisibrowse Technical Demo. Take a screenshot. Record a video. If working properly, the website will appear fully black.
Invisibrowse works by embedding a single-color paused portion of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management" title="Digital rights management">DRM</a> (Digital Rights Management)-protected video, and overlaying black text above the video. DRM video is used by websites such as Netflix to prevent screenshotting or recording any of their content.
When DRM video is screenshotted, recorded, screenshared, or accessed in any way other than from viewing the physical screen, it displays as pure black. Black text above a identical black background is Invisible. The "gray" link text is really transparent black text that appears gray on a white background and fully black on a black background.
Invisibrowse is primarily designed to prevent school or parent-installed spyware from viewing your entire screen. There are quite a few extensions that can view your screen, including GoGuardian and Securly.<br>
<b>This is a technical demo, currently missing vital features and security measures.</b> You can search and browse the text of all Wikipedia articles invisibly, and that's it.
A 1.0 update will release in December 2025 with the following features:
<ul><li>Ability to search the entire web + enter URLs and browse text content
</li><li>Invisible, shuffling virtual keyboard to defend against keylogging
</li><li>Obfuscation to prevent spyware from tampering with or recording content
</li><li>Defense against Alt+Tab, which currently exposes content at a very low resolution in some cases
</li><li>Fix issue where resizing window to be larger can sometimes expose content
</li><li>Invisible mouse cursor for added security
</li><li>Ensuring content is not displayed while DRM is loading</li></ul>Future updates will include (in order of estimated release date):<ul><li>Grayscale images
</li><li>Optional dark mode
</li><li>Configuration options to change Wisp server, theme, tab name, etc.
</li><li>Support for Safari and mobile browsers (including Webview)
</li><li>Initially optional &lt;canvas&gt; display mode
</li><li>Chat (ideally with multiple services supported, including Discord)
</li><li>A fix for lag when zooming in and out (if possible)
</li><li>Video content (if possible)
</li><li>Full color (if possible)
</li><li>Offline mode (if possible)</li></ul>Made by <a href="https://underdevelopedprefrontalcortex.github.io">Underdevelopedprefrontalcortex</a>. Credits:
